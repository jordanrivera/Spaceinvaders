# Spaceinvaders

The Space Invaders Video Game is the final project of The University of British Columbia's How to Code: Simple Data online course offered on edx.org. There are notable additions that distinguish my game from others. I have listed them to benefit others who may utilize my code to expand upon their own:

 - space invaders move at different speeds
- space invaders move in different directions
- the conclusion of the game is met with the GAME OVER screen
